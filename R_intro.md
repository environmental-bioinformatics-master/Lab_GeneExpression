# Intro to data manipulation & plotting in R

After installing, load libraries:

```
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(Lahman)
```

# data.table: github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki\
*  Data wrangling
*  Extension of data.frame
*  Can easily subset and operate on data in rows and columns, and perform operations by group(s)
*  Alternative to dplyr – use whatever works for you

Easy, "smart" loading of data files\
Don't need to specify delimiter, column classes, etc - fread will work it out\
`YOUR_DAT = fread("FILE_PATH")`

Put Lahman table into data.table form\
`bat = as.data.table(Batting)`

With the table from Lahman, there is a LOT of data\
`Batting`

With data.table, large files will automatically show top & bottom 5 lines (not all)\
`bat`

Subsetting data\
`bat20 = bat[yearID >= 1920]`

Select column(s)\
`batSub = bat[, list(playerID, yearID)]`\
`batSub`

Select on multiple conditions\
`batSub = bat[yearID >= 1920 & teamID == "CIN"]`

Or, can chain subset conditions / commands\
`batSub = bat[yearID >= 1920][teamID == "CIN" | teamID == "BOS"][,list(playerID,yearID,teamID)]`

Sort the data by team\
`bat[order(teamID)]`

Sort the data by games AND team
`bat[order(G,yearID)]`

Sum hits and at-bats by league and year\
`batSum = bat[, .(N = .N, at_bats = sum(AB), hits = sum(H)), by = .(yearID, lgID)]`

Calculate league-wide batting average\
`batSum$lgAve = batSum$hits/batSum$at_bats`

# ggplot2: gg = “grammar of graphics”
*  `aes()` - aesthetics (what variables you are plotting – x, y, etc)
*  `geom_` - geometries (how you are plotting them – scatter, line, histogram, etc)
*  `theme()` - basic appearance tweaks (font type, size, tick marks, legend control, etc)
*  ...and much, much more

Let's plot! League average versus year\
`ggplot(batSum, aes(x = yearID, y = lgAve)) + geom_point()`

`Color-code leagues for easier viewing\
`ggplot(batSum, aes(x = yearID, y = lgAve, color = lgID)) + geom_point()`

Gap in American League - this is because Designated Hitter rule was in force between 1973-1995 (interleague play)\
SO, there are NAs because pitchers have no at-bats\
Won't calculate sums / etc with NAs\

Let's fix it! Exclude them!\
We can operate on a prior table - no need to separately add an extra column, we can calculate off initial summary table\
`batSum = bat[AB != "NA", .(N = .N, at_bats = sum(AB), hits = sum(H)), by = .(yearID, lgID)][,.(lgAve = hits/at_bats), by = .(yearID, lgID)]`

Let's connect the dots\
`ggplot(batSum, aes(x = yearID, y = lgAve, color = lgID)) + geom_path()`

Let's zoom in on more modern baseball, with just the two current leagues\
`ggplot(batSum, aes(x = yearID, y = lgAve, color = lgID)) + geom_path() + xlim(1901,2018)`

Dip in 1960s was when the pitching mound was lowered (1969)\
Gap b/n leagues in 1930s (pre-war), partly due to Joe DiMaggio & Ted Williams in the AL\

Let's look at differences between leagues in a single year, by player\
Exclude players who weren't at bat very often\
`yearComp = bat[(yearID == 1941 & AB > 400), .(N = .N, playerAve = H/AB), by = .(playerID, lgID)]`

Make a whisker plot\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = lgID, y = playerAve)) + geom_boxplot()`

Holy cats! Ted Williams is a monster outlier. "The greatest hitter who ever lived." - Ted Williams

Can overlay one plot type on another, if the mapping is compatible\
Let's put points on the boxplots\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = lgID, y = playerAve)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()`

Kind of hard to see with overlap - let's jitter them a little from side to side\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = lgID, y = playerAve)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter()`

That's a LOT of scatter. Let's restrict it a bit\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = lgID, y = playerAve)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width=0.3)`

Wait - were there TWO Ted Williamses? No - seeing outlier from boxplot PLUS scatter point\
Let's color the overlain points to make this clearer\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = lgID, y = playerAve)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width=0.3, color = "red")`

Let's look at the distribution with a histogram\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = playerAve)) + geom_histogram()`

What about league differences? Let's make this a stacked, color-coded histogram\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = playerAve, fill = lgID)) + geom_histogram()`

Don't like that background?\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = playerAve, fill = lgID)) + geom_histogram() + theme_bw()`

Now let's customize our labels\
`ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = playerAve, fill = lgID)) + geom_histogram() + theme_bw() + xlab("Batting average") + ylab("Number of players")`

This is getting messy. Let's save the base graph and embellish it.\
`plot = ggplot(yearComp, aes(x = playerAve, fill = lgID)) + geom_histogram()`
`fplot = plot + theme_bw() + xlab("Batting average") + ylab("Number of players")`

Take out the legend\
`fplot + theme(legend.position = 'none')`

Make it more granular\
`fplot + stat_bin(binwidth = 0.02)`

Let's go back to our yearly data set to play with formatting some more\
First, let's restrict it to just AL & NL\
`batSel = batSum[lgID == "AL" | lgID == "NL"]`

Now, let's enter data and make it slightly prettier\
`plot = ggplot(batSel, aes(x = yearID, y = lgAve, color = lgID)) + theme_bw() + xlab("Year") + ylab("League-wide batting average")`

Show points\
`plot + geom_point()`

Add a smoothing curve (loess by default but several options are available)\
`plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth()`

Let's tighten up that loess\
`plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = .1)`

Kind of hard to see - let's separate out the data (facet)\
`plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = .1) + facet_wrap(~lgID)`

How about vertical facets?\
`plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = .1) + facet_wrap(~lgID, ncol = 1) + theme(legend.position = 'none')`

Let's rename the facets for easy reading\
Here's an option if you don't want to change your underlying data\
```
lgNames = c("AL" = "American League", "NL" = "National League")
plot + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = .1) + facet_wrap(~lgID, ncol = 1, labeller = as_labeller(lgNames)) + theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
